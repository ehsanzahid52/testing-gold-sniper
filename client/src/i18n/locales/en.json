        "content": "When dealing with this precious metal on the OTC market, it is critical to remember that one standard lot equals 100 troy ounces. XAU Is a gold symbol in the gold market. Brokers provide traders the chance to profit from the pricing of this asset by transacting on the XAU/USD pair. The graph depicts the price of one ounce of metal in US dollars. Brokers need a minimum contract amount of 0.01 from the lot, which means that you must have 1,550 USD to begin trading gold (including commissions). The greatest degree of leverage available to inexperienced traders is on average 1:1000; nevertheless, dealing with such a large volume of borrowed funds poses severe trading dangers. The ideal degree of leverage is 1:100. When using leverage, it is critical to pay close attention to the margin trading conditions. Some brokerages set the Stop Out (forced closing of a trade with a poor financial outcome) at 60-70 percent of the trader's deposit, while others put it at 20-30 percent. Furthermore, keep in mind the rules of money management in financial markets. The risk per transaction should not be more than 5-10%. To comply with these requirements, you should deposit at least $200 USD into a trading account."
